# Data-Science-Models
Here I organize some data analysis process templates that I perform, involving some data processing and modeling techniques.

For this development I used the database with information about breast cancer present in sklearn, but which was saved in a .csv for some modifications, for example, adding a new variable (Family Case) and in some others removing the information from the line to test the filling of missing data.
